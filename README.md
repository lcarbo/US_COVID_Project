# US_COVID_Project
Bootcamp Project 1 - Analyzing US COVID Data

In this project we explored the distribution of COVID cases across the US, and how it may relate to key metrics such as median houshold income, population density per state. 

To do this we used Pandas, Python, US Census API, Google Maps API, and data from The COVID Tracking Project.
